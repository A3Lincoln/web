<p>GO, AHEAD AND TELL ME
YOU’VE GOT ALL YOU WANT
FIVER SAYS YOU’RE WRONG
AND I SUPPOSE, YOU’VE COME DOWN TO HELP ME
MOVE THINGS ALONG</p>

<p>AND WE LAPPED IT UP WHEN WE’RE WISE ENOUGH TO KNOW
HOW IT GOES, FORGIVE ME HONEY
BUT WE’RE WISE ENOUGH TO KNOW
HOW IT GOES, FORGIVE ME HONEY
CAUSE WE KNOW THIS FEELING
ALL A LITTLE TOO WELL</p>

<p>LISTEN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US
COULD’VE TOOK A WHILE
ONCE WE CLOSED THAT DIFFERENCE
YOU’D TURN UP LIKE A FRIEND OF MINE
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THE LITTLE THINGS MAKE ME SMILE AS IF
ONE OF OUR LONGSHOTS PAID OFF</p>

<p>SO YEAH GO, AHEAD AND TELL ME
SOMETHING REAL
C’MON HOW’D YA FEEL?
AND I SUPPOSE, YOU’VE COME DOWN TO HELP ME
ADD SCENES TO THE REEL</p>

<p>WHILE WE LAPPED IT UP WHEN WE’RE WISE ENOUGH TO KNOW
HOW IT GOES, FORGIVE ME HONEY
BUT WE’RE WISE ENOUGH TO KNOW
HOW IT GOES, FORGIVE ME HONEY
CAUSE WE KNOW THIS FEELING
ALL A LITTLE TOO WELL</p>

<p>LISTEN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US<br>
COULD’VE TOOK A WHILE<br>
ONCE WE CLOSED THAT DIFFERENCE<br>
YOU’D TURN UP LIKE A FRIEND OF MINE<br>
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THE LITTLE THINGS MAKE ME SMILE AS IF<br>
ONE OF OUR LONGSHOTS PAID OFF<br>
ONE OF OUR LONGSHOTS PAID OFF</p>

<p>AND IT’S BY-THE-BY<br>
IF IT MAKES THOSE NIGHTS FLY<br>
WHEN WE’RE SIDE-BY-SIDE AGAIN<br>
AND NOW WE’RE ALL CARELESS AND LOVED UP<br>
Y’KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT GOES<br>
WHEN YOU’RE GIVING US ALL KIND OF REASON<br>
FOR THE HEAD TO GO<br>
FOLLOW THE HEART I BELIEVE IN<br>
‘CAUSE ONE OF US MUST KNOW<br>
WHEN YOU’RE GIVING US ALL KIND OF REASON<br>
FOR THE HEAD TO GO<br>
FOLLOW THE HEART I BELIEVE IN<br>
‘CAUSE IN THE PAST IT’S DONE ME GOOD</p>

<p>LISTEN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US<br>
COULD’VE TOOK A WHILE<br>
ONCE WE CLOSED THAT DIFFERENCE<br>
YOU’D TURN UP LIKE A FRIEND OF MINE<br>
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THE LITTLE THINGS MAKE ME SMILE AS IF<br>
ONE OF OUR LONGSHOTS PAID OFF</p>

<p>LISTEN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US<br>
COULD’VE TOOK A WHILE<br>
